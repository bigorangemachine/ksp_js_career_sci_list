Kerbal Space Program - Science Checklist Generator - Alpha
======================
[Check out the demo](http://bigorangemachine.github.io/ksp_js_career_sci_list) at [bigorangemachine.github.io/ksp_js_career_sci_list](http://bigorangemachine.github.io/ksp_js_career_sci_list) to get your own generated Science Career Checklist.  There is 'some' support for Science Experiment Addons and Extra Planets.  Currently tested with 0.23.

If there are any issues please use the github ticket system (issues on the right).  When you do provide a ticket I will need you to attach your save game file in a non-compressed format (no zips/rars/tars).

Works best in Firefox.  Tested in Firefox and in Chrome.

###For JavaScript Developers

Documentation Coming soon.  

Checkout js/ksp.parser.js.  

The parser should be generic enough that someone else could develop a Delta V calculator for a specific ship within the save file.  I haven't looked into it too much but maybe someone else would be interested in that.  If anyone uses this for anything please let me know!
